$activePlanGUID = (powercfg -getactivescheme).split()[3]

# Change the settings of the active plan
# For example, to set the turn-off display time to "Never" for both battery and plugged-in modes:
powercfg -change -monitor-timeout-dc 0
powercfg -change -monitor-timeout-ac 0
powercfg -change -standby-timeout-ac 0
powercfg -change -standby-timeout-dc 0

# If you want to rename the plan, you can use the following command:
# powercfg -changename $activePlanGUID "New Plan Name"
